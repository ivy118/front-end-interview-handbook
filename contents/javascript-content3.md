### Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea?
Extending a built-in/native JavaScript object means adding properties/functions to its `prototype`. While this may seem like a good idea at first, it is dangerous in practice. Imagine your code uses a few libraries that both extend the `Array.prototype` by adding the same `contains` method, the implementations will overwrite each other and your code will break if the behavior of these two methods is not the same.

The only time you may want to extend a native object is when you want to create a polyfill, essentially providing your own implementation for a method that is part of the JavaScript specification but might not exist in the user's browser due to it being an older browser.

### Difference between document `load` event and document `DOMContentLoaded` event?

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
`window`'s `load` event is only fired after the DOM and all dependent resources and assets have loaded.

### What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

`==` is the abstract equality operator while `===` is the strict equality operator. The `==` operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. The `===` operator will not do type conversion, so if two values are not the same type `===` will simply return `false`. When using `==`, funky things can happen, such as:

```js
1 == '1'; // true
1 == [1]; // true
1 == true; // true
0 == ''; // true
0 == '0'; // true
0 == false; // true
```
My advice is never to use the `==` operator, except for convenience when comparing against `null` or `undefined`, where `a == null` will return `true` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`.

```js
var a = null;
console.log(a == null); // true
console.log(a == undefined); // true
```

### Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?
Every script has access to the global scope, and if everyone uses the global namespace to define their variables, collisions will likely occur. Use the module pattern (IIFEs) to encapsulate your variables within a local namespace.

### Why would you use something like the `load` event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?
The `load` event fires at the end of the document loading process. At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.
The DOM event `DOMContentLoaded` will fire after the DOM for the page has been constructed, but do not wait for other resources to finish loading. This is preferred in certain cases when you do not need the full page to be loaded before initializing.

### What is the extent of your experience with Promises and/or their polyfills?

Possess working knowledge of it. A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future: either a resolved value or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
Some common polyfills are `$.deferred`, Q and Bluebird but not all of them comply with the specification. ES2015 supports Promises out of the box and polyfills are typically not needed these days.

### What are the pros and cons of using Promises instead of callbacks?
**Pros**
- Avoid callback hell which can be unreadable.
- Makes it easy to write sequential asynchronous code that is readable with `.then()`.
- Makes it easy to write parallel asynchronous code with `Promise.all()`.
- With promises, these scenarios which are present in callbacks-only coding, will not happen:
  - Call the callback too early
  - Call the callback too late (or never)
  - Call the callback too few or too many times
  - Fail to pass along any necessary environment/parameters
  - Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen

**Cons**
- Slightly more complex code (debatable).
- In older browsers where ES2015 is not supported, you need to load a polyfill in order to use it.

### What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?
For objects:
- `for-in` loops - `for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }`. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an `obj.hasOwnProperty(property)` check before using it.
- `Object.keys()` - `Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.keys()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.
- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` - `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.

For arrays:
- `for` loops - `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`. The common pitfall here is that `var` is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces `let` which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`.
- `forEach` - `arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... })`. This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the `index` if all you need is the array elements. There are also the `every` and `some` methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.
- `for-of` loops - `for (let elem of arr) { ... }`. ES6 introduces a new loop, the `for-of` loop, that allows you to loop over objects that conform to the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol) such as `String`, `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, etc. It combines the advantages of the `for` loop and the `forEach()` method. The advantage of the `for` loop is that you can break from it, and the advantage of `forEach()` is that it is more concise than the `for` loop because you don't need a counter variable. With the `for-of` loop, you get both the ability to break from a loop and a more concise syntax.

Most of the time, I would prefer the `.forEach` method, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. Before ES6, we used `for` loops when we needed to prematurely terminate the loop using `break`. But now with ES6, we can do that with `for-of` loops. I would use `for` loops when I need even more flexibility, such as incrementing the iterator more than once per loop.

Also, when using the `for-of` loop, if you need to access both the index and value of each array element, you can do so with the ES6 Array `entries()` method and destructuring:

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (let [index, elem] of arr.entries()) {
  console.log(index, ': ', elem);
}
```
### Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects.
Immutability is a core principle in functional programming, and has lots to offer to object-oriented programs as well. A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

#### What is an example of an immutable object in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, some built-in types (numbers, strings) are immutable, but custom objects are generally mutable.
Some built-in immutable JavaScript objects are `Math`, `Date`.
Here are a few ways to add/simulate immutability on plain JavaScript objects.

**Object Constant Properties**
By combining `writable: false` and `configurable: false`, you can essentially create a constant (cannot be changed, redefined or deleted) as an object property, like:

```js
let myObject = {};
Object.defineProperty(myObject, 'number', {
  value: 42,
  writable: false,
  configurable: false,
});
console.log(myObject.number); // 42
myObject.number = 43;
console.log(myObject.number); // 42
```

**Prevent Extensions**
If you want to prevent an object from having new properties added to it, but otherwise leave the rest of the object's properties alone, call `Object.preventExtensions(...)`:

```js
var myObject = {
  a: 2,
};
Object.preventExtensions(myObject);
myObject.b = 3;
myObject.b; // undefined
```
In non-strict mode, the creation of `b` fails silently. In strict mode, it throws a `TypeError`.
**Seal**
`Object.seal()` creates a "sealed" object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.preventExtensions()` on it, but also marks all its existing properties as `configurable: false`.

So, not only can you not add any more properties, but you also cannot reconfigure or delete any existing properties (though you can still modify their values).

**Freeze**
`Object.freeze()` creates a frozen object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.seal()` on it, but it also marks all "data accessor" properties as writable:false, so that their values cannot be changed.

This approach is the highest level of immutability that you can attain for an object itself, as it prevents any changes to the object or to any of its direct properties (though, as mentioned above, the contents of any referenced other objects are unaffected).
```js
var immutable = Object.freeze({});
```
Freezing an object does not allow new properties to be added to an object and prevents from removing or altering the existing properties. `Object.freeze()` preserves the enumerability, configurability, writability and the prototype of the object. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

#### How can you achieve immutability in your own code?
One way to achieve immutability is to use libraries like [immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), [mori](https://github.com/swannodette/mori) or [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer).
The alternative is to use `const` declarations combined with the techniques mentioned above for creation. For "mutating" objects, use the spread operator, `Object.assign`, `Array.concat()`, etc., to create new objects instead of mutate the original object.

Examples:
```js
// Array Example
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Object Example
const human = Object.freeze({race: 'human'});
const john = {...human, name: 'John'}; // {race: "human", name: "John"}
const alienJohn = {...john, race: 'alien'}; // {race: "alien", name: "John"}
```
### Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.
Synchronous functions are blocking while asynchronous functions are not. In synchronous functions, statements complete before the next statement is run. In this case, the program is evaluated exactly in order of the statements and execution of the program is paused if one of the statements take a very long time.

Asynchronous functions usually accept a callback as a parameter and execution continue on the next line immediately after the asynchronous function is invoked. The callback is only invoked when the asynchronous operation is complete and the call stack is empty. Heavy duty operations such as loading data from a web server or querying a database should be done asynchronously so that the main thread can continue executing other operations instead of blocking until that long operation to complete (in the case of browsers, the UI will freeze).


### What is event loop? What is the difference between call stack and task queue?
The event loop is a single-threaded loop that monitors the call stack and checks if there is any work to be done in the task queue. If the call stack is empty and there are callback functions in the task queue, a function is dequeued and pushed onto the call stack to be executed.

### Explain the differences on the usage of `foo` between `function foo() {}` and `var foo = function() {}`
The former is a function declaration while the latter is a function expression. The key difference is that function declarations have its body hoisted but the bodies of function expressions are not (they have the same hoisting behavior as variables). For more explanation on hoisting, refer to the question above [on hoisting](#explain-hoisting). If you try to invoke a function expression before it is defined, you will get an `Uncaught TypeError: XXX is not a function` error.
**Function Declaration**

```js
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
```
**Function Expression**

```js
foo(); // Uncaught TypeError: foo is not a function
var foo = function () {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
};
```
### What are the differences between ES6 class and ES5 function constructors?
Let's first look at example of each:

```js
// ES5 Function Constructor
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// ES6 Class
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

For simple constructors, they look pretty similar.
The main difference in the constructor comes when using inheritance. If we want to create a `Student` class that subclasses `Person` and add a `studentId` field, this is what we have to do in addition to the above.

```js
// ES5 Function Constructor
function Student(name, studentId) {
  // Call constructor of superclass to initialize superclass-derived members.
  Person.call(this, name);

  // Initialize subclass's own members.
  this.studentId = studentId;
}
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

// ES6 Class
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, studentId) {
    super(name);
    this.studentId = studentId;
  }
}
```
It's much more verbose to use inheritance in ES5 and the ES6 version is easier to understand and remember.

### What advantage is there for using the arrow syntax for a method in a constructor?
The main advantage of using an arrow function as a method inside a constructor is that the value of `this` gets set at the time of the function creation and can't change after that. So, when the constructor is used to create a new object, `this` will always refer to that object. For example, let's say we have a `Person` constructor that takes a first name as an argument has two methods to `console.log` that name, one as a regular function and one as an arrow function:

```js
const Person = function (firstName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.sayName1 = function () {
    console.log(this.firstName);
  };
  this.sayName2 = () => {
    console.log(this.firstName);
  };
};
const john = new Person('John');
const dave = new Person('Dave');
john.sayName1(); // John
john.sayName2(); // John

// The regular function can have its 'this' value changed, but the arrow function cannot
john.sayName1.call(dave); // Dave (because "this" is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.call(dave); // John

john.sayName1.apply(dave); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.apply(dave); // John

john.sayName1.bind(dave)(); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.bind(dave)(); // John

var sayNameFromWindow1 = john.sayName1;
sayNameFromWindow1(); // undefined (because 'this' is now the window object)

var sayNameFromWindow2 = john.sayName2;
sayNameFromWindow2(); // John
```

The main takeaway here is that `this` can be changed for a normal function, but the context always stays the same for an arrow function. So even if you are passing around your arrow function to different parts of your application, you wouldn't have to worry about the context changing.

This can be particularly helpful in React class components. If you define a class method for something such as a click handler using a normal function, and then you pass that click handler down into a child component as a prop, you will need to also bind `this` in the constructor of the parent component. If you instead use an arrow function, there is no need to also bind "this", as the method will automatically get its "this" value from its enclosing lexical context. (See this article for an excellent demonstration and sample code: https://medium.com/@machnicki/handle-events-in-react-with-arrow-functions-ede88184bbb)


### What is the definition of a higher-order function?
A higher-order function is any function that takes one or more functions as arguments, which it uses to operate on some data, and/or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are meant to abstract some operation that is performed repeatedly. The classic example of this is `map`, which takes an array and a function as arguments. `map` then uses this function to transform each item in the array, returning a new array with the transformed data. Other popular examples in JavaScript are `forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`. A higher-order function doesn't just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function. `Function.prototype.bind` is one such example in JavaScript.

**Map**
Let say we have an array of names which we need to transform each string to uppercase.
```js
const names = ['irish', 'daisy', 'anna'];
```
The imperative way will be as such:
```js
const transformNamesToUppercase = function (names) {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    results.push(names[i].toUpperCase());
  }
  return results;
};
transformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']
```
Use `.map(transformerFn)` makes the code shorter and more declarative.

```js
const transformNamesToUppercase = function (names) {
  return names.map((name) => name.toUpperCase());
};
transformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']
```
### Can you give an example of a curry function and why this syntax offers an advantage?
Currying is a pattern where a function with more than one parameter is broken into multiple functions that, when called in series, will accumulate all of the required parameters one at a time. This technique can be useful for making code written in a functional style easier to read and compose. It's important to note that for a function to be curried, it needs to start out as one function, then broken out into a sequence of functions that each accepts one parameter.

```js
function curry(fn) {
  if (fn.length === 0) {
    return fn;
  }
  function _curried(depth, args) {
    return function (newArgument) {
      if (depth - 1 === 0) {
        return fn(...args, newArgument);
      }
      return _curried(depth - 1, [...args, newArgument]);
    };
  }
  return _curried(fn.length, []);
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
var curriedAdd = curry(add);
var addFive = curriedAdd(5);
var result = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(addFive); // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
### What are the benefits of using spread syntax and how is it different from rest syntax?
ES6's spread syntax is very useful when coding in a functional paradigm as we can easily create copies of arrays or objects without resorting to `Object.create`, `slice`, or a library function. This language feature is used often in Redux and RxJS projects.

```js
function putDookieInAnyArray(arr) {
  return [...arr, 'dookie'];
}

const result = putDookieInAnyArray(['I', 'really', "don't", 'like']); // ["I", "really", "don't", "like", "dookie"]
const person = {
  name: 'Todd',
  age: 29,
};

const copyOfTodd = {...person};
```

ES6's rest syntax offers a shorthand for including an arbitrary number of arguments to be passed to a function. It is like an inverse of the spread syntax, taking data and stuffing it into an array rather than unpacking an array of data, and it works in function arguments, as well as in array and object destructuring assignments.

```js
function addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(...numbers) {
  return numbers.map((x) => x + 5);
}

const result = addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10); // [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
const [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // a: 1, b: 2, rest: [3, 4]
const {e, f, ...others} = {
  e: 1,
  f: 2,
  g: 3,
  h: 4,
}; // e: 1, f: 2, others: { g: 3, h: 4 }
```
